Proof-of-Concept for minimal-code-size CPace25519.

This library extends the tweetnacl library by the extensions needed for CPace.

Howto run the "testsuite".

gcc -o test.exe tweetnacl_cpace25519.c tests_tweetnacl_cpace25519.c -DCPACE_IR -DCPACE_SYM
./test.exe


In your application include the tweetnacl_cpace25519.h Header and add the single file
tweetnacl_cpace25519.c to your build Environment. Define either of 
the -DCPACE_IR -DCPACE_SYM compile switches depending on your use of CPace (ordered
Messages with clear initiator and responder or symmetric instantiation).
